Description artwork: After a year of hiding in the Shadows
Description project: "After a year of hiding in the Shadows" this project is my genesis piece for mint fun. I am a superchain digital illustrator currently working on Ethereum L2 networks. Artist for 12 years working with visual stories creating narratives of surreal worlds in collision with reality. This project belongs to a series of works that explore the loss and inner search of who we are and what we face in our lives, representing those “enemies” as shadows that follow us wherever we go.
